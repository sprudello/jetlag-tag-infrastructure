++Add a countdown timer to the frontend that fetches data from the /GetPenalty/{userId} endpoint. Display the remaining minutes in two locations: the welcome-section of the user overview and the challenges tab. The timer should update in real-time and handle edge cases like expired penalties. Ensure the display is consistent across both locations and properly formats the remaining minutes value. The api response is {
+    +  "endTime": "2025-04-29T14:06:10.9354062",
+    +  "durationInMinutes": 30,
+    +  "remainingMinutes": 16.02
+    +}
+    +but since the endTime is in UTC+0 and the user is not in UTC+0 you need to use remainingMinutes as timer. the displayed time should be in mm:ss in red and as long as there is no penalty it should be green and saying User has no penalty.
+    +(add a covnersion from endTime(With utc+0) to user's timezone without using it for any functionality other than for the console.log, get the user's timezone without asking)
